Categorized Document Library Listing

This solution aims to support a resource library that an IT department or HR department might provide to their community.  For example, IT creates a few dozen guides and other types of help in PDF, DOC, etc. format.  These cover topics like "how to use the phone", "OMG, I forgot my password" and stuff like that.  

IT uploads these documents into a document library, tags them as normal and then provide a nice view to that library using this solution.

Why not use standard SharePoint you ask?  You may well want to do that, but this is a nicer, cleaner and more user friendly look.

Brief History:
==============
10/15/2014: Initial repo created in github with MIT license

10/19/2014: First steps toward search.  Added category counts and a bit of a message indicating when a category has no actual documents associated with it.  Changed the "selected categories" from a simple array to an array of objects (cat name and cat count).
